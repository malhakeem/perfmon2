## Summary of the task:
In this project we examine the heterogeneity of the DBaaS pricing models used by different cloud vendors, specifically Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud. Based on the obtained models, we implement a tool that estimates the financial cost for a selection of different DBaaS options and suggests the optimal solution according to requirements provided by the user.
